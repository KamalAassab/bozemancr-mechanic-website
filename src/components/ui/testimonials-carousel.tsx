They gave me status updates often, were very transparent and informative about everything explaining my all my options along the way, and maintain a clean professional environment. The Audi motor and drivetrain fit and run like OEM in my R and it is SO AWESOME!!! I am a car enthusiast / perfectionist with high expectations who is picky, meticulous, and wouldn't trust my car to anyone but Alex at Innovative because I know he is too.",

      content: "I met the owner (Alex) at a car show and he gave me a run down on the problems I was having with my car build. Alex then took the time to use a scan tool to run a diagnostic check. Most places charge an arm and a leg, but instead he gave a business card. Later they scheduled me in ASAP, and even stayed late at the shop because I was stuck in traffic. He and the crew at innovative motorsports worked tirelessly for a week to get all of the parts installed. I fell in love all over again with my old GTI because of these guy's efforts. Highly recommended for anyone looking to tune, maintain, or repair their European car!",

I drove over 200 miles to use them since they were the only shop I trusted my car with. I had them put a big turbo kit (Stg 3) in my Golf R and have been nothing but impressed with their work. They have a great relationship with United Motorsports Tuning, and they have been able to turn my car into a little monster! The work was completed on time & within budget and they kept me updated throughout the whole process. I can't recommend this shop enough!",

The communication throughout the build was excellent, and they delivered exactly what they promised. The shop is clean, professional, and the team is incredibly knowledgeable.
