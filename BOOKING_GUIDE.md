For BozemanCR, I recommend:

**START:** Email method (already active)
- Immediate results, no setup needed
- Customers get instant feedback
- You control the process

**UPGRADE LATER** (if volume increases):
- Switch to Calendly for automation
- Keep email as fallback option
- Total investment: Still $0!
