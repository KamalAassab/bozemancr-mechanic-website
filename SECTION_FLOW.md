## 📊 **Conversion Psychology**

This follows the **AIDA model:**

1. **A**ttention → Hero
2. **I**nterest → Services & About
3. **D**esire → Gallery, Partners, Instagram
4. **A**ction → FAQ + Contact

---

## ✅ **Benefits:**

- Better conversion: services and trust before contact
- Logical flow: services → why you → proof → FAQs → action
- Clear path: what → why → how → when → where
- Fewer drop-offs: stronger reasons before asking for contact

---

## 🔄 **Old Order (Before):**

```
Hero → AdditionalServices → Gallery → Partners → PerformanceMods → About → FAQ → Contact → Instagram
```

**Problems:**
- Gallery too early (low context)
- Performance split from Services
- Contact far from social proof

---

## ✅ **Result:**

Professional layout aligned with mechanic site patterns.
